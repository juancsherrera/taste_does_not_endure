**Abstract**  Network science studies of food recipes offer insights into food culture and food preferences by investigating recipes as complex systems composed of individual parts such as ingredients, preparation techniques, and recipe titles which are linked to each other. This stream of literature has acknowledged the relevance of using longitudinal approaches but only a few studies have done so. This paper uses network science on a newly collected recipe dataset spanning 1977-2017 to show that taste, as a set of ingredient combinations, variates over time. These changes can be attributed broadly to culture as it establishes patterns that influence ingredient choice. This study presents an analysis of two different categories of ingredients using network science of food recipes and qualitative analysis of other sources to illustrate these changes. The first corresponds to animal proteins and evidences the impact Lent, Christmas, and New Year’s Eve in the selection of ingredients. The second, on sweeteners, shows how sugar’s central role is being challenged as substitutes such as honey and sugarloaf gained ground in recent years, thus reflecting debates on health and the negative impacts of sugar. This study advances the literature of network science of food recipes, food studies, network science, and historical network research by demonstrating the importance of considering longitudinal approaches to gain a profoud understanding of food culture which is constantly changing, reflecting broader changes in taste arising from ideas, economics, politics, and taste.
